This repository contains information and code from my project portfolio for UC Berkeley Master in Information & Data Science (MIDS) degree (in progress -- expected April 2019). Key projects have been selected from the following completed course subjects:

+ *Data Engineering*
  - Flight Delay Prediction Engine - an analysis of 35 million different flight records combined with local weather data to build a machine learning model that could predict the likelihood of a flight delay
+ *Machine Learning*
  - Click Through Rate Prediction - a scalable cloud-based implementation of a Factorization Machines (FM) machine learning implementation to predict click through probabilites for display advertising
  - Cancer Image Detection - a scalable cloud-based data pipeline for processing medical images in order to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify breast cancer
  - Customer Churn Prediction - data processing and modeling for a music subscription service to use logistic regression to predict customer churn probabilities based on user profile, transaction activity, and usage patterns
+ *Statistics*
+ *Experiments*
+ *Data Visualization*
